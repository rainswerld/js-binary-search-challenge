# JS Binary Search Challenge

For this challenge, you will be writing a function that performs a Binary
Search. Please follow [this link](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/cs-algorithms#predicting-complexity)
from the `Prerequisites` and read the section describing the algorithm before
beginning.

## Prerequisites

- [ga-wdi-boston/cs-data-structures](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/cs-data-structures)
- [ga-wdi-boston/cs-algorithms](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/cs-algorithms)

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Install dependencies.
1. Create and checkout a new branch to work on.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Starter code is available in [`lib/challenge.js`](lib/challenge.js). A pull
request is not required, but it is necessary if you want a code review.

You may wish to refer to [FAQs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/)
related to [forking and
cloning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone).

## Requirements

Implement a function `binarySearch` that is given a sorted array, a callback,
and a value to locate within the array. Your function should return the value
from the array. It should achieve this by invoking the callback the correct
amount of times based on the [definition of Binary Search.](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/cs-algorithms#predicting-complexity)

You should be running `grunt nag` before diagnosing any bugs, since it finds
some of the most common sources of errors. After `grunt nag` passes, you should
run `grunt test` to run the included tests. Tests will tell you whether or not
you've met these requirements.

The tests will ensure that you are completing a Binary Search with the
appropriate runtime complexity.
